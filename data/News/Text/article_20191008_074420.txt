The Showtime hit series “Billions,” which portrays the collision  of the worlds of law and hedge funds, has concluded a chapter of  its own real-life legal drama ⁠- for now.
  Performance coach Denise Shull filed suit against Showtime in  January on the grounds that Maggie Siff’s character Wendy Rhoades  was inspired by Shull’s book, “Market Mind Games,” as reported by    The Hollywood Reporter’s Ashley Cullins. In the show, Siff  plays a performance coach working at a hedge fund who is caught  between her boss and her husband, a US attorney.
  On Friday, US District Judge George Daniels ruled in Showtime’s  favor, canceling Shull’s lawsuit because the court found the show  and the book “do not seem to resemble each other in the least,”  Daniels wrote in his   decision, which was published by THR.
  But Shull plans to appeal the decision, the author’s lawyers    told Deadline reporter Dominic Patten.
  “We have reviewed the Court’s decision and respectfully disagree  with the court’s ruling,” attorney Michael James Malory said to  Deadline.
  Daniels wrote that the court found no similarities between Shull  and “Billions” character Wendy Rhoades, other than the fact that  both women work as in-house performance coaches at hedge funds.  But that alone is not enough to justify claims of copyright,  according to the decision.
  “An in-house psychiatrist may not be a ‘stock character,'”  Daniels wrote, “but the idea of an in-house psychiatrist, even in  the context of a hedge fund, is certainly not one that was borne  of Shull’s own thinking.”
  Siff   spoke to Business Insider last year about various  inspirations for her character, citing life coach Tony Robbins as  well as Ari Kiev, who was the in-house psychiatrist at SAC  Capital before he died in 2009.
  While the court dismissed the suit against Showtime, it denied  the network’s request to be compensated for attorney fees and  costs, according to the decision.
