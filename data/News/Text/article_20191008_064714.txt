When it comes to saving space on your   Mac computer, there  are many things you can do – empty the trash, delete app  installers, get rid of duplicate files, and more. 
  You can also reduce the file size of PDF documents in order to  make them more compact, and take up less space on your   Mac.
  However, it’s important to note that doing so may also decrease  the quality of the original PDF.
  If you need a high-quality PDF, for a presentation or work  assignment, you may be better off using another space-saving  method, like saving it to cloud-based backup system or an  external hard drive.
  But if you decide it’s the right way to go, here’s what you’ll  need to do in order to reduce the file size of a PDF on your    Mac, via the Preview app.
  As long as you know which file you want to reduce, this should be  a quick and easy process:
 1. Open the PDF – if Preview isn’t your default  app, right click the PDF, then select “Open with” followed by  “Preview.”
 
 2. Once the file is open, go up to the top  toolbar and select “File” and then “Export.”
 
 3. You’ll see a pop-up window appear over the  top-middle section of the PDF – click the drop-down menu next to  “Quartz Filter” and select “Reduce File Size.”
 
 4. Click “Save.”
