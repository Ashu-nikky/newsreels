One of the most affordable streaming services on the market is  coming to your TV soon. 
 Disney+, a new ad-free streaming  service created by the Walt Disney Company, becomes available  on November 12.
  The highly anticipated service will feature programming from not  only Disney, but also all of Disney’s subsidiaries: Pixar,  Marvel, Star Wars, National Geographic, and 20th Century Fox. 
  Subscribers can enjoy movies and TV series old and new, including  programming that can only be found on Disney+. 
  Find more information about the cost and features of Disney+  below. 
  There are a few different prices, depending on whether you want  to pay on a monthly basis, commit to a yearlong subscription, or  bundle Disney+ with Hulu and ESPN+. Regardless of which you  choose, you get a seven-day free trial to see whether you want to  sign up for the full subscription.  
 Seven-day trial for new subscribers: Free 
 Month-by-month subscription: $6.99/month
 Yearly subscription: $69.99/year, or $5.83/month
 Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ bundle:  $12.99/month ($18/month if you sign up for each service  individually)
  Disney+ offers a competitive price. Here’s how it compares to  other popular, non-live TV streaming services. The prices shown  are for the ad-free plans (if applicable). 
 Netflix: $8.99 to $15.99/month 
 Hulu: $11.99/month

  If you would also like sports content and movies and TV from  non-Disney sources, you should consider the bundle option. The  Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ bundle, which also  becomes available on November 12, costs $12.99/month. If you sign  up for each of these services individually, the total would come  out to $18/month.
