One of the most remarkable aspects of the   iPhone is its powerful camera. That’s more true than ever  with the recently announced   iPhone 11 Pro, which features not just two, but three camera  lenses.
  But for those of us still living with our older   iPhones, there are camera settings that can help us take  great shots, too.
  One of the most useful is “HDR,” or “High dynamic range.”  Enabling this setting can elevate an average photo to an  extraordinary shot.
  Here’s what the setting means, and how to make sure you’re taking  advantage of it.
  Here’s a common scenario: You want a shot of someone in front of  a gorgeous outdoor backdrop, but doing so means they’ll be  blasted with overly-bright backlighting. 
  Rather than having to choose between focusing on your subject and  losing the background, or vice-versa, HDR makes it so you can  experience both in one photograph. 
  How? By taking three photos consecutively at different exposures  – one normal, and one each adjusted for the brightest and darkest  details. 
  The end result: a final photo with the best of everything. 
  On older iPhones, you can set HDR manually by tapping its icon  when you’re taking a picture (as depicted below in step five).  Newer models of iPhone, however, are automatically set to use HDR  when deemed necessary, with a setting called “Smart HDR.”
  But you can still manually control the feature. Here’s how.
 1. Open your iPhone’s Settings app. 
 2. Search or select “Camera.”
 

 3. Disable the slider for Smart HDR so it turns  white.
 4. Close Settings and open your Camera.
 
 5. HDR will now appear as a setting in the  top-left corner.
  This lets you turn HDR on and off whenever you like. Just tap it  when using your camera.
