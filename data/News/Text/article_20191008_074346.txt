The actor Joaquin Phoenix plays a man slowly spiraling into  madness in “Joker,” but that doesn’t mean he can’t have a bit of  fun in real life.
  A viral outtake from the set of “Joker,” which was presented on  “Jimmy Kimmel Live” last week, showed Phoenix in his  character’s makeup yelling at someone named “Larry” to “shut up”  with the “constant whispering.”
  “Larry,” in this scenario, is the movie’s cinematographer,  Lawrence Sher. Sher told Business Insider during an interview on  Monday that the outtake originated as a prank on the “Joker”  director Todd Phillips and that it was all Phoenix’s idea.
  “It was a bit,” Sher said. “Joaquin is actually a super playful  guy and loose.”
  Sher said that Phoenix wanted to pull a prank on Phillips and  “get into a fight.” So Phoenix requested another take of the  scene they were filming, which takes place near the end of the  movie after Phoenix’s character, Arthur, dons the Joker’s  signature green hair and white makeup. But the joke went right  over everyone’s head.
  “He’s such a good actor that nobody even got it on set,” Sher  said. “He played it too straight.”
  Sher had no idea that the clip would air on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,”  and he was bombarded with messages from friends and family  afterward.
  “My son asked if it would hurt my reputation,” he said.
