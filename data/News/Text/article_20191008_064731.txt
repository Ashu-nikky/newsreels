Apple TV Plus hasn’t launched yet, but Apple has already  considered packaging its on-demand video service with its  streaming music service, Apple Music.
  A new report from   Anna Nicolaou and Patrick McGee of the Financial Times says  that Apple has entered into talks with the music industry to make  a subscription bundle a reality, but record labels are concerned  that they will lose revenue from the deal.
  Apple Music is a $10 monthly subscription, though Apple customers  who buy an iPhone, iPad or Mac get one year of the service for  free. Apple TV Plus will launch on November 1 for $5 per month,  and will feature original TV shows, movies, and documentaries.  Earlier this year, Apple launched Apple News Plus for $10 per  month, and the $5 per month Apple Arcade, a subscription video  game service.

  While Apple has not formally announced any plans to combine its  growing list of subscription services, a discounted bundle would  provide additional value to dedicated customers. However, the  Financial Times report suggests that music industry executives  are wary of accepting a deal that would lead to lower revenue  shares from Apple Music streaming.
   According to the Financial Times, the music industry’s  skepticism goes back to the early days of Apple’s iTunes store,  when former Apple CEO Steve Jobs leveraged access to the growing  digital marketplace to get record labels to agree to a price of  $0.99 per song.
  The music industry has benefitted from the advent of streaming  music service, but licensing negotiations remain a point of  tension between streaming platforms and record labels. Industry  executives told the Financial Times that Apple Music currently  offers a more favorable rate of revenue sharing than Spotify, the  world’s most popular music streaming service.
