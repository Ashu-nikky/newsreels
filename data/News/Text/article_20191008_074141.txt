Despite all the capabilities of an   Apple Watch, it’s not very good at playing video. 
  There’s no YouTube  app for the watch, for example, and for the most part, you can’t  watch videos on your wrist. 
  But there is one significant exception – you can play videos  embedded in SMS and iMessages.
  Here’s how to do it.  
 1. To watch a video on your Apple Watch, it must  be a video file that’s embedded in a text message (SMS or  iMessage). It can’t be a link (like a YouTube URL), and it can  only be sent via a message. You can receive a message from  someone else or you can send a video in a text message to  yourself from your iPhone. 
 2. When you receive the message, tap the video  thumbnail. The video should start to play.
 
 3. Tap the screen to pause the video. Tap again  to resume playback. 
 
 4. You can adjust the volume with the Digital  Crown.
 5. When you’re finished, tap “Done.”
  You can return to the message in your Messages app to watch the  video again later. 
  Unfortunately, you can’t play video from a link on your   Apple Watch. If you try, you’ll generally get a message that  says your browser does not currently recognize the video file.
