You probably wouldn’t think of chugging a glass of water, or  talking to another person as “power-ups,” but app SuperBetter is  reframing mental health upkeep as a game.
  Anxiety disorders are the most  common mental illness in the US, affecting 40 million adults,  a potentially huge market for apps that claim to help alleviate  symptoms to tap into. Anxiety is   already a big business, with the rise of products including    fidget spinners, weighted blankets, coloring books, and more.
  Other apps, like Happify,  also use the trend of gamification as a way to market  anti-anxiety practices, like meditation and overcoming negative  thoughts. In Happify, you get silver or gold medals for  successfully completing steps, while in SuperBetter you can do  power-ups, battle bad guys, and complete quests.
  Dr. Cameron Sepah, a psychologist who works primarily with tech  executives and VCs in his San Francisco private practice,  believes that “digital therapeutics,” like these apps, are the  future of mental healthcare, because they are more easily  scaleable and accessible than traditional therapy. He says that  the next generation of mental health apps won’t look like  traditional treatments, instead they will be more like games.
  “The next great mental health app will look like Pokemon Go, and  SuperBetter is the closest I’ve seen so far,” he told Business  Insider in a phone call.
 Here’s how these game-like mental health apps  work:

 A  randomized trial conducted by The University of Pennsylvania  found that using the app for 30 days “significantly reduced  symptoms of depression and anxiety.”
  An   NIH study at Ohio State University found that the symptoms of  teens with concussions improved more while playing SuperBetter  for 3-6 weeks than a control group.
