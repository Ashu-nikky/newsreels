America might have landed on the moon, but Russia drilled the  deepest man-made hole on Earth.
  Since the early 1960s, scientists have attempted to drill down to  the Earth’s mantle. 
  It took 20 years, but Russia drilled down 40,230 feet into the  earth, before heat forced work to stop. Despite reaching such a  depth, Russia never got to the mantle. But nearby residents have  said they can hear   souls screaming in hell coming from it.
  After that, Germany and Japan entered the race. But, still, no  one’s managed to drill to the mantle.
  Outside of science, oil companies have drilled deep and narrow to  extract oil, and mining companies have dug large and wide to  extract copper and diamonds.
  These are the deepest and largest man-made holes in the world.
